## Description

CryptoNets is a demonstration of the use of Neural-Networks over data encrypted with [Homomorphic Encryption](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/hits09/gentry-homomorphic-encryption.pdf).
Homomorphic Encryptions allow performing operations such as addition and multiplication over data while it is encrypted. 
Therefore, it allows keeping data private while outsourcing computation (see [here](http://homomorphicencryption.org/) and [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/homomorphic-encryption/) for more about Homomorphic Encryptions and its applications).
This project demonstrates the use of Homomorphic Encryption for outsourcing neural-network predictions. The scenario in mind
is a provider that would like to provide Prediction as a Service (PaaS) but the data for which predictions are needed may be private. 
This may be the case in fields such as [health](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/manual-for-using-homomorphic-encryption-for-bioinformatics/) or finance.
By using [CryptoNets](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/gilad-bachrach16.pdf), the user of the service can encrypt their data using Homomorphic Encryption and send only the encrypted message to the service provider.
Since Homomorphic Encryptions allow the provider to operate on the data while it is encrypted, the provider can make predictions using a pre-trained
Neural-Network while the data remains encrypted throughout the process and finaly send the prediction to the user who can decrypt the results. During the process
the service provider does not learn anything about the data that was used, the prediction that was made or any intermediate result since everything is encrypted
throughout the process.

This project uses the [Microsoft SEAL](http://sealcrypto.org) version 3.2 implementation of Homomorphic Encryption developed in [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/).
The project is made of three components:
1. A wrapper for Homomorphic Encryption that allow working with matrices and vectors while hiding much of the underlying crypto.
2. Implementation of main Neural-Network layers using the wrapper.
3. Implementation of specific Neural-Networks using the framework.

The networks that are currently implemented are [CryptoNets](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/gilad-bachrach16.pdf) and [Low-Latency CryptoNets (LoLa)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10659) that operate on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
as well as versions of LoLa that operate on the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and [CalTech-101](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/) datasets. The project also includes a small demonstration of using the wrapper for Homomorphic Encryption for 
performing computations that are not necessarily Neural-Networks.

# Installation
The project is designed to be built using Visual-Studio 2017 and was tested in the windows environment used .Net framework version 4.6.2.

To install the project follow the following steps
### 1. Install SEAL
This project depends on SEAL version 3.2. Download this version of SEAL from [http://sealcrypto.org]. Note that CryptoNets does not support SEAL 3.3 which uses a different API. Instead, you can checkout version 3.2 using the command `git checkout 3.2.2`. In order to obtain best performance introduce the following change to the code of SEAL before compiling:

Open SEAL/native/src/seal/evaluator.cpp and in the are_same_scale function change the the arguments to be: const T &value1, const S &value2.

Use the instructions in [https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/blob/master/dotnet/nuget/NUGET.md] to create a NuGet package. Once done, copy the nuget package to the root directory of this project (where the solution file CryptoNets.sln is).

### 2. Build CryptoNets
* Download all CryptoNets files.
* Open the CryptoNets solution using Visual Studio and compile the project. Make sure to target x64 and use either Release or Debug mode.

### 3. Prepare data files
* Change Directory to the .\bin\x64\Release or .\bin\x64\Debug directory (depending on the choice of build you used).
* Use DataPreprocess.exe to obtain and prepare the datasets you are interested in. For each of the datests (MNIST/CIFAR/CAL) issue the command *DataPreprocess.exe dataset-name*. Instructions on where to download the data from will be displayed. After downloading the data to the local directory issue the command *DataPreprocess.exe dataset-name* again to preprocess the data.

# Running
After downloading and preparing the data you can test the different applications. Note that if you build the code in Debug mode more information may be displayed. 
Here we demonstrate the outputs for Release mode.
### Basic Examples
This project does not require any data. Issue the command *BasicExample.exe* which will generate output similar to
```

### CryptoNets
This project requires the MNIST data. It implements the [CryptoNets](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/gilad-bachrach16.pdf) but with SEAL 3.2 as opposed to SEAL 1.0 that was used in the original paper.
To run, issue the command *.\CryptoNets.exe*. The expected output is 
```

### LowLatencyCryptoNets
This project implements different [LoLa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10659) versions on MNIST. Note that the paper uses SEAL 2.3 while here we use SEAL 3.2, so the expected performance is slightly better.
To run this project use the command *.\LowLatencyCryptoNets* with the following parameters:

> -v, --verbose    (Default: false) Set output to verbose messages. In the verbose mode more information is presented

> -e, --encrypt    (Default: false) Use encryption. In encrypted mode the network operates on encrypted data, otherwise it operates on plain data

> -n, --network    Required. Type of network to use (LoLa, LoLaDense, LoLaSmall, LoLaLarge)

For example, the command *.\LowLatencyCryptoNets -n LoLa -e* will generate the following output:
```

```


### CifarCryptoNets
This project implements [LoLa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10659) on the CIFAR dataset. The version implemented here defers from the one in the paper in several ways: 
- The version here uses SEAL 3.2 whereas the paper version uses SEAL 2.3
- The network here is slightly different. It has better accuracy of 76.31% and runs at ~750 seconds on an Azure VM B8ms

To run, issue the command *.\CifarCryptoNets.exe* with the following parameters:

> -v, --verbose    (Default: false) Set output to verbose messages. In the verbose mode more information is presented

> -e, --encrypt    (Default: false) Use encryption. In encrypted mode the network operates on encrypted data, otherwise it operates on plain data

For example, the command *.\CifarCryptoNets -e* will generate the following output:
```
